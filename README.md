# ocr_final_project

Generate data (text -> <image of lines>) with the following command.
```
python3 extract-lines.py <src text file> <output-dir>
```
`<output-dir>` will be populated with a bunch of jpegs and text files (the labels).
Here's naming convention: `xxx.<quality>.png` and `xxx.txt`.

Generate character images (text image -> individual character images) with the following command.
```
python3 segment.py <src text image file> <output-dir>
```
`<output-dir>` will contain an image for each text line of the input image with the format `line<X>.<quality>.jpg`
	and an image for each character of the input image with the format `line<X>.char<Y>.<quality>.jpg`.

# train the line-level CRNN with this
```
python3 src/train.py <data-dir generated by extract-lines.py>
```

# Try out the generated model with this
```
python3 src/infererence.py ocr.model <image of a single line>
```
